As Generative AI continues to advance, the performance drivers for data center infrastructure are shifting from systems\\-on\\-chip (SOCs) to systems of chips. In the era of Accelerated Computing, data center bottlenecks are no longer limited to compute performance, but rather the system's interconnect bandwidth, memory bandwidth, and memory capacity. Celestial AI's Photonic Fabric™ is the next\\-generation interconnect technology that delivers a tenfold increase in performance and energy efficiency compared to competing solutions.



The Photonic Fabric™ is available to our customers in multiple technology offerings, including optical interface chiplets, optical interposers, and Optical Multi\\-chip Interconnect Bridges (OMIB). This allows customers to easily incorporate high bandwidth, low power, and low latency optical interfaces into their AI accelerators and GPUs. The technology is fully compatible with both protocol and physical layers, including standard 2\\.5D packaging processes. This seamless integration enables XPUs to utilize optical interconnects for both compute\\-to\\-compute and compute\\-to\\-memory fabrics, achieving bandwidths in the tens of terabits per second with nanosecond latencies.



This innovation empowers hyperscalers to enhance the efficiency and cost\\-effectiveness of AI processing by optimizing the XPUs required for training and inference, while significantly reducing the TCO2 impact.
